## Playing the game:-

- The objective of the game is to score as much as possible.
- The player of the game is the red coloured ball and the enemies are the balls of various other colors.
- Score increases as the player hits/destroys the enemy balls.
- Score, Level and Lives are displayed on the top of the screen.
- Game level will increase after every increase of 1000 points in the score.
- On levelling up, speed of enemy balls increases.
- Basic physics has been strictly implemented in the game.
- On landing on the trampoline, the ball is reflected back into the air with high speed.
- When the player is inside the water body(pond), movement speed is slowed down.The player ball follows the curve until the lowermost point is reached(provided the player isnâ€™t explicitly moving it sideways). If the player is moving left or right, he should follow the path along the semi-circle.
- After landing on the moving porcupines, the porcupine disappears and the Player's lives decreases by 1.
- Game will end when the player ball loses all its lives.
- Magnet appears many times for some period of time during the game play and affects the horizontal motion of player.
- Some enemy balls have inclined planes of different sizes attached to them. After hitting these inclined planes, player bounces following laws of reflection.
